        <line>Preview your NISO STS document.</line>
        <description>
            <p>NISO STS is an XML-based documentary format being adopted at NIST and more widely as an interchange format supporting the publication, exchange, re-use and sustainable (accessible) archiving of documentation relating to standards and guidelines. As a documentary format it is both richer and more rigorous than HTML.</p>
            <p>Use this Previewer to see how a NISO STS-tagged document <i>might</i> appear in display (that is, in your browser, cast dynamically from its source tagging).</p>

            <p><i>View Source</i> to see the XML source from which the page is produced. In display it looks the same, in this case by design.</p>
            <p>In addition to clean project descriptions, the directory provides a control point for top-level site navigation.</p>

            <p>This directory is loaded dynamically into the index page, at user request. Uses the same XSLT as for <a href="directory.xml">the directory pushed as XML</a>.</p>

        <description>
            <p>An XSLT can render a document for display; it can also discover and signal where known issues are detected, requirements are not satisfied, or rules are broken.</p>

        <name>Site Templating</name>
        <line>Static site generator, old school</line>
        <description>
            <p>A NodeJS CL tool to read an HTML file and deliver a transformed HTML file would be the basis for a static site generator in Node JS + XSLT. (This might have to be Saxon-based if only for XSLT outside the browser.)</p>
            <p>Then make an application of this for site templating.</p>
            <p>Deploy as either page setup or CI/CD (push) step (or both)?</p>

        <line>Even older school alternative supporting hand-crafted pages</line>
        <description>
            <p>Instead of templating, this application works by validating an HTML document to see how well it is templated. It could check for the presence of normative boilerplate and report when it is not found ... questions would be, how (and even when and whether) to maintain updates and checks for updates.</p>
            <p>This could be built as a helper application providing chunks of code for a user to copy out, when a page is found to be out of order.</p>

            <p>Load JSON and spill it onto the page, as HTML.</p>
            <p>This is a very rudimentary application in place mainly for sake of testing the concept and stabilizing the (germ of a) code base that can carry it out.</p>

        <name>CSV Tabulator</name>
        <description>
            <p>Rather than supporting people's dependencies on spreadsheets (like the Excel Drill), this application permits converting arbitrary CSV (such as might be exported by a spreadsheet) into a grid or table (configured by the user), perhaps then written out as OSCAL or other structured format ready for use in other applications?</p>

            <p>Essentially this is a mini-<a href="https://xsweet.org">XSweet</a> for a browser using only XSLT 1.0 (see how that goes)</p>
            <p>Also require (un)zip functionality, resource wrapping (or other runtime interface with XSLT engine) etc. etc.</p>
