        <description>
            <p>NISO STS is an XML-based documentary format being adopted at NIST and more widely as an interchange format supporting the publication, exchange, re-use and sustainable (accessible) archiving of documentation relating to standards and guidelines. As a documentary format it is both richer and more rigorous than HTML.</p>
            <p>Use this Previewer to see how a NISO STS-tagged document <i>might</i> appear in display (that is, in your browser, cast dynamically from its source tagging).</p>

            <p><i>View Source</i> to see the XML source from which the page is produced. In display it looks the same, in this case by design.</p>
            <p>In addition to clean project descriptions, the directory provides a control point for top-level site navigation.</p>
            <p>Don't expect much from the demonstration: the point is that the page looks and works the same. But it is also a test of your browser's support of XML with stylesheets (straight-up XML source) rather than HTML with scripting (capable of delivering XML transformed into HTML).</p>

                the user to initiate loading the directory, thereby testing the infrastructure while providing these links. For display, the same XSLT is applied as for <a href="directory.xml">the directory acquired as XML</a>.</p>

        <name>OSCAL Boilerplate</name>
        <line>Styling your OSCAL with CSS</line>
        <description>
            <p>Like any XML, OSCAL XML can be displayed in the browser natively, using CSS for layout and typography, almost entirely meeting requirements for many simple applications for document review and the like.</p>
            <p>Where <q>almost entirely</q> isn't enough, a project such as <a href="https://dcl.ils.indiana.edu/teibp/">TEI Boilerplate</a> demonstrates how even a very lightweight XSLT shim can do the rest.</p>
            <p>In this application, one should be able to load an OSCAL file and then either load or edit CSS and have it applied dynamically. A small accompanying chart would document where the XSLT transformation intervenes to expand text (for example: parameter value insertions), create links or map into HTML directly. This would enable the user effectively to control the entire look/feel of the document as presented, on top of a plain and transparent OSCAL foundation and framing.</p>

        <name>XSLT Security Awareness</name>
        <line>XSLT, what could go wrong? Risk assessment guidelines and helper application</line>
        <description>
            <p>A page can document known risks associated with XSLT and the XML-based systems that support them (parser ecosystem etc.)</p>
            <p>Supporting this, an XSLT loaded by the user can be run through an XSLT, to query and report back on calls and dependencies,                 including (more ideas please) <code>xsl:import</code>, <code>xsl:include</code>, <code>document()</code>, parameter usage etc. - not as risks in themselves, but as points to be assessed. This could include fine points such as use of <code>xsl:copy</code> passing through unsanitized scripts, etc.</p>
            <p>Such an XSLT diagnostic could also report interesting findings (to code analysts) such as target tag set and namespace; mode usage; key usage; <code>xsl:apply-templates/@select</code> and so forth. (In XSLT 2.0, tunnel parameters, stylesheet variables and micropipelines.) Think of this less as a style guide or (de-)linter, more of an analytic crunch-out/synopsis.</p>
            <p>This can be done separately for XSLT 1.0 and XSLT 3.0, with XSLT 1.0 being an easier lift.</p>
            <p>The page can also cover <q>when you need to assess XSLT</q>, giving attention to the layered architecture and understanding potential threats in context. So you don't end up mistaking the risks or costs and thus losing opportunities.</p>

        <description>
            <p>A NodeJS CL tool to read an HTML file and deliver a transformed HTML file would be the basis for a static site generator in Node JS + XSLT. (This might have to be Saxon-based if only for XSLT outside the browser.)</p>
            <p>Then make an application of this for site templating.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Instead of templating, this application works by validating an HTML document to see how well it is templated. It could check for the presence of normative boilerplate and report when it is not found ... questions would be, how (and even when and whether) to maintain updates and checks for updates.</p>
            <p>This could be built as a helper application providing chunks of code for a user to copy out, when a page is found to be out of order.</p>
