# HTML Reducer application

## Aims

## Maintenance plan

## XSLT Version

XSLT 1.0 for lightest possible browser footprint and consistently with the host project [XSLT Blender](../README.md).


## Architecture

`html-reducer.xsl` does all the work. It can apply equally to any XML, XHMTL, or HTML file that can be parsed by a DOM parser.
