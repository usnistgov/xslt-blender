# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Individual projects within the site will be at different points in a development lifecycle. Discovered vulnerabilities, however, may apply to the architecture or library not just to a specific project; so any apparent vulnerability must be assessed.

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Before it has been examined and assessed, please do not publish or disclose specific information about any software vulnerability by any public means, whether by discussing in chat rooms, mailing lists or other open forums. In discussing vulnerabilities in general, take care to consider your (immediate and eventual) audiences as well as how you characterize problems, risks, defenses and solutions.

With regard to known vulnerabilities of XSLT 1.0 applications as supported by DOM Level 4, see the project wiki page on [Vulnerabilities](../wiki/Vulnerabilities) and related discussions. This resource is built to be extended over time as we learn more. Known vulnerabilities *with defenses or solutions*, in general terms, may also be discussed on the project [Issues](../issues) board (and in community channels).

With regard to new vulnerabilities, please send any information to contact points given in the project [README](README.md#contact-info). Consider any vulnerability to be new if it is not documented by this project or in other accessible resources as suggested by a due-diligent search.

Depending on the nature of the vulnerability, further action will be taken; newly discovered vulnerabilities along with defenses may also be published in time.
