# XSLT Blender Architecture

This page is a placeholder and waypoint for documentation on the XSLT Blender architecture.

![System Architecture Diagram](/images/logo.png)

A diagram shows static and dynamic components of a generic XSLT Blender application.

Note that while calling it "XSLT Blender" here, there is nothing about that name - this is only and nothing more than XSLT 1.0 supported by Javascript. Anyone could write the Javascript and call it something else: this architecture also may describe other (simple) web applications.

The wiki page on [[Architecture]] gives a fuller explanation with long description of the diagram.
